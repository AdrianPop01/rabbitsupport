		<p>Rabbits</p>
		<p>Here are some more details on the Rabbits we currently have up for adoption:</p>
		<p>Morocco:<br />Morocco is very outgoing and cuddly. He loves attention and is happy to be picked up and carried around. Morocco is a young guy but has relatively good manners for a teenage boy</p>
		<p>Bunson:<br />&nbsp;
         Bunson is about three years old, and his mature attitude is a real pleasure. He keeps an extremely neat room and generally has a relaxed approach to life.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; Billy and Mandy:<br />&nbsp;
         Billy and Mandy are siblings and would prefer to be rehomed together. They are both around five years old.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; Greta:<br />&nbsp; 
        Greta is a gentle tabbycat in need of a new home after her old owner passed away. All she needs in the world is a warm lap to cuddle up on affectionately.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; Jacob:<br />&nbsp; 
        Jacob was rescued from the back of an icecream truck after seeking shelter there. He had been living rough for quite some time before that and as such takes a little while to get used to new people. Jacob would prefer being the only cat in his house.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; Nairobi comes from the same rescue as Morocco. He's a little more reserved than Morocco but interested in everything around him</p>
		<p>&nbsp; Ronnie is a wild and crazy boy. He's a teenager, so you have to be patient. He can and will jump out of any pen and run for the hills, so be sure you've got all the doors closed. He sure is cute, though.</p>
